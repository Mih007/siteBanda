    <h2>CHLORINE</h2>
    <h3>Lyric</h3>
    <h4>So where are you? It's been a little while <br>
        Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me<br>
        This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
        When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
        The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
        Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
        Lovin' what I'm tastin'<br>
        Venom on my tongue<br>
        Dependant at times<br>
        Poisonous vibration<br>
        Help my body run<br>
        I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
        Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
        Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me<br>
        This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
        When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
        The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
        Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
        Fall out of formation<br>
        I plan my escape from walls they confined<br>
        Rebel red carnation<br>
        Grows while I decay<br>
        I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
        Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
        Yeah, I'm runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
        Runnin' for my li-i-i-i-i-i-fe<br>
        Had you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red<br>
        I felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head<br>
        Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead<br>
        The last two lines may read incorrect until said<br>
        The lead is terrible in flavor<br>
        But now you double as a papermaker<br>
        I despise you sometimes<br>
        I love to hate the fight and you in my life is like<br>
        Sippin' on straight chlorine, let the vibes slide over me<br>
        This beat is a chemical, beat is a chemical<br>
        When I leave don't save my seat, I'll be back when it's all complete<br>
        The moment is medical, moment is medical<br>
        Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Beat is a chemical, yeah<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Moment is medical, yeah<br>
        Sippin' on straight chlorine<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Beat is a chemical, yeah<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Let the vibe, let the vibe<br>
        Moment is medical, yeah<br>
        I'm so sorry, I forgot you<br>
        Let me catch you up to speed<br>
        I've been tested like the ends of<br>
        A weathered flag that's by the sea<br>
        Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
        I'm just a chemical<br>
        Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
        I'm just a chemical<br>
        Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
        I'm just a chemical<br>
        Can you build my house with pieces?<br>
        I'm just a chemical<br>
