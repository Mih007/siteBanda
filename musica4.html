    <h2>JUMPSUIT</h2>
    <h3>Lyric</h3>
    <h4>Cover me, oh <br>
        I can't believe how much I hate<br>
        Pressures of a new place roll my way<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
        I crumble underneath the weight<br>
        Pressures of a new place roll my way<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
        Spirits in my room, friend or foe?<br>
        Felt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit (cover me)<br>
        Dusting off my, jumpsuit (cover me)<br>
        I can't believe how much I hate<br>
        Pressures of a new place roll my way<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
        I'll be right there (I'll be right there)<br>
        But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air<br>
        If you need anyone<br>
        I'll stop my plans (I'll stop my plans)<br>
        But you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands<br>
        If you need anyone<br>
        I'll be right there (I'll be right there)<br>
        But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air<br>
        (If you need anyone) if you need anyone<br>
        (If you need anyone) if you need anyone<br>
        (If you need anyone) if you need anyone<br>
        I can't believe how much I hate<br>
        Pressures of a new place roll my way<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me<br>
        Oh, jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!<br>
        Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
