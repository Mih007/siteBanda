    <h2>STRESSED OUT</h2>
    <h3>Lyric</h3>
    <h4>I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard <br>
        I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words<br>
        I wish I found some chords in an order that is new<br>
        I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang<br>
        I was told when I get older, all my fears would shrink<br>
        But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think<br>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
        Wish we could turn back time<br>
        To the good old days<br>
        When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
        But now we're stressed out (oh)<br>
        Wish we could turn back time (oh)<br>
        To the good old days (oh)<br>
        When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
        But now we're stressed out<br>
        We're stressed out<br>
        Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young<br>
        How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?<br>
        I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it<br>
        Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one<br>
        It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose<br>
        Same clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam<br>
        But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered<br>
        Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter<br>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
        My name's Blurryface and I care what you think<br>
        Wish we could turn back time<br>
        To the good old days<br>
        When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
        But now we're stressed out (oh)<br>
        Wish we could turn back time (oh)<br>
        To the good old days (oh)<br>
        When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
        But now we're stressed out<br>
        Used to play pretend, give each other different names<br>
        We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away<br>
        Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying<br>
        "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah<br>
        We used to play pretend, give each other different names<br>
        We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away<br>
        Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying<br>
        "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah<br>
        Wish we could turn back time<br>
        To the good old days<br>
        When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
        But now we're stressed out (oh)<br>
        Wish we could turn back time (oh)<br>
        To the good old days (oh)<br>
        When our mama sang us to sleep<br>
        But now we're stressed out<br>
        We used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
        We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money<br>
        Used to play pretend, used to play pretend, money<br>
        We used to play pretend, wake up, you need the money<br>
        Used to play pretend, give each other different names<br>
        We would build a rocket ship and then we'd fly it far away<br>
        Used to dream of outer space, but now they're laughing at our face saying<br>
        "Wake up, you need to make money", yeah<br>
