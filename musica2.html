    <h2>RIDE</h2>
    <h3>Lyric</h3>
    <h4>I just wanna stay in the sun where I find <br>
        I know it's hard sometimes<br>
        Pieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind<br>
        I know it's hard sometimes<br>
        Yeah, I think about the end just way too much<br>
        But it's fun to fantasize<br>
        On my enemies who wouldn't wish who I was<br>
        But it's fun to fantasize<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
        Takin' my time on my ride<br>
        "I'd die for you" that's easy to say<br>
        We have a list of people that we would take<br>
        A bullet for them, a bullet for you<br>
        A bullet for everybody in this room<br>
        But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through<br>
        See many bullets coming through<br>
        Metaphorically, I'm the man<br>
        But literally, I don't know what I'd do<br>
        "I'd live for you" and that's hard to do<br>
        Even harder to say, when you know it's not true<br>
        Even harder to write, when you know that's a lie<br>
        There were people back home who tried talking to you<br>
        But then you ignore them still<br>
        All these questions they're for real, like<br>
        "Who would you live for?"<br>
        "Who would you die for?"<br>
        And "Would you ever kill?"<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
        Takin' my time on my ride<br>
        I've been thinking too much<br>
        I've been thinking too much<br>
        I've been thinking too much<br>
        I've been thinking too much (Help me)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (Help me)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)<br>
        I've been thinking too much
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time<br>
        Takin' my time on my ride<br>
        Whoa, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm taking my time on my ride<br>
        Oh, oh, oh, oh<br>
        I'm fallin' so I'm takin' my time on my-<br>
        I've been thinking too much (Help me)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (Help me)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (Help me)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (I've been thinking too much)<br>
        I've been thinking too much (Help me)
